We propose empirical comparison of regret performances of Greedy-like and UCB-like strategies, namely ExploitASAP and LinUCB. To make it easy, we do this via a ShinyApp.

Please download files foo.R and app.R within the same repository and source file app.R. The ShinyApp will then be loaded, allowing you to play around will the bandit problem parameters and compare the performances of both strategies.
